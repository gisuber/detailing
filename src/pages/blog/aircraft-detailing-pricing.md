The pricing for aircraft detailing services depends on several factors. The key determining factor is the size of the aircraft, the level of service required, and the location of the business. Some aircraft detailing businesses may charge by the hour, while others may charge a flat rate for their services.

## Aircraft Detailing Service and Cost

Many businesses have a menu-style pricing system for their exterior services, with additional charges for any specialized services such as cleaning the spinners. The cost can vary greatly depending on the specific needs of the aircraft.

For example, an exterior wash for a small aircraft like a Cessna may start at around 100 dollars, while a large jet may cost up to 600 dollars. Additional services such as engine polishing can range from 275 dollars for a small aircraft to 2,500 dollars for a large jet. Any specialized services such as cleaning the boots or spinners will be added to the base price.

Some aircraft detailing businesses only offer exterior services, while others also include interior detailing. The cost of interior detailing can range from 75 dollars for a small turboprop to 350 dollars for a large jet, depending on the level of cleanliness and the work required. A full cabin refurbishment can cost thousands of dollars and may involve the removal of seats and brightwork, and take several days to complete.

Some aircraft detailing businesses offer monthly maintenance plans, which can provide customers with a discounted rate for year-round services.
